Summary: Through this visualization i want to convery the following message:
  **The survival preferences were given the young females who belong the 1st passenger class.** 
  Visual encoding used:
  1.x-axis: on X-axis i have age bracket as (infant(0-14),Adult(15-60),Senior(More than 60 yrs)) and sex of passenger.
  2.y-axis: on Y-axis i have passenger survival percentage out of total no of passenger.
  3.Category: I have catagories data on the basis of sex of passenger.
  4.Animation: I have used storyboard to show the survival passenger classwise.
  5 Interactivity: To display chart for the specific passenger.

Design - 
Narrative Introduction:
 Through this visualization i want to convey the following message:
 The survival preference were given the young females who belong the 1st passenger class.Same demonstration is shown throught the chart that around 41% of female from first passenger were survived. and 32% of the female were survived from the 2nd passenger class and only 12% of the female were survived from the
 3rd passenger class.
 
 I have made 3 major design changes after creating the first draft:
 
  1. Intially i have choosed facet chart to tell the story showing 3 chart for 3 passenger class was good to show the story, but i got feedback that viewer has to focus on the 3 charts one by one and then to identify the story (class 1 passenger females were given most preference.).As a part of feedback i have used 1 chart with animation for each class.
  2. Once i have used the single chart with animation on the passenger class things were bit clean. for the clarity purpose i have used a label in between the graph which used to tells for what passenger class we are viewing the chart and i have also side bars for interactivity for each class. As a part of feedback i have changed the color of side bars whenever we are viewing the chart for particular passenger class and remove the label from the middle of chart.
  3.after consuming the above two feedback in my visualization. it was looking great , but again i got one feedback on y axis label. i was showing the count of passenger survived.which was not telling the complete picture,so instead of no. of passenger survived i have used percentage of passenger survived out of total no. of passenger in the ship.which completes the story i want to convey.

feedback - following are the feedback i got.
  1. Use single chart with animation instead of facet chart.
  2. Do not use same information from two places ( from labels in the middle of chart and side bars).
  3. On Y-axis percentage of survived passenger out total passenger should be shown to convey the complete story.
  4. Title was missing from the chart.
